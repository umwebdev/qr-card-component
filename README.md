## Overview

This is the first challenge from the frontendmentor’s “Getting started on Frontend Mentor” learning path. This challenge required creating a QR card component, which was responsive out of the box due to its compact design. This first challenge was more about getting to know how frontendmentor challenges work and how to solve the challenge and share the solution in an effective and professional manner.

## My process

#### 1. Analyzing the Design and Setting Up the Dev environment

First I analysed the design files and the design system for the QR component, that helped with figuring out the reusable css classes and variables. also i set up the project folder with all the assets like images and fonts and created the required HTML and CSS files.

#### 2. Writing the HTML Markup

After setting up the dev environment and initializing the required HTML and CSS files, using HTML5 semantic tags, I started with the markup for the QR card component.

#### 3. CSS Styling and responsiveness

After writing the HTML markup, I started with styling of the qr card component. setting up reuseable classes and CSS variables in the first step really helped speed up the process. The width of the card component was such that it did not need any extra attention for making it responsiveness on smaller screen sizes.

#### 4. Final touches, testing and deployment

I reviewed the code before pushing to github to fix any possible issues and make sure everything was in order. I made sure everything worked fine across all devices, browsers and different screensizes.

After making sure that everything was in order I pushed the code to the github repo and deployed on vercel.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS3
- CSS variables
- Flexbox

### What I learned

- using dvh instead of vh
- using display: block; on img elements instead of display: inline; or display: inline-block;
- using semantic html elements

### Continued development

I would love to learn more about creating, generating, and customizing QR codes.

### Useful resources

Here are some useful resources to learn the basics of HTML, CSS and CSS Flexbox.

## Acknowledgments

I would like to say thanks to the lovely folks at frontendmentor for providing such neatly laid out designs. The design system was impressive and helped a great amount with figuring out reuseable styles at a glance. I no longer need to worry about creating clean layouts from scratch, I can now solely focus on what I love—translating visions into websites.
